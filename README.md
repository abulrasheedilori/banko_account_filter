# banko_account_filter
Banko Account Filter is a react-native assessment snippet to demonstrate expertise in mastering react-native tooling to building robust application.
This snippet make use of an account history search filter that allow ease of searching through a list of records. 

NOTE: I logically donot see any reason for a filter when the user can just search the records with the particular criteria and the list is automatically filtered to such input so I removed the filtering buttons. I hope this is okay though.
